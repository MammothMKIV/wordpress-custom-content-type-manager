#summary Where to download this plugin

= Where to Download =

Normally his plugin can be downloaded from the !WordPress.org site:

[http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/custom-content-type-manager/ http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/custom-content-type-manager/]

However, if !WordPress is feeling petulant and has blocked downloads due to some imagined boogyman in the comments of some files, then you can download the latest release here: [http://wpcctm.com/custom-content-type-manager.zip 0.9.5.13.zip]

Kinda silly !WordPress is so adamant about perceived licensing violations when the software ships with copyrighted lyrics from "Hello Dolly".  

= Developers Download =

http://downloads.wordpress.org/plugin/custom-content-type-manager.zip

_"Sir, it's quite possible this development branch is not entirely stable."_

Keep in mind that I can't maintain older versions of the plugin.
