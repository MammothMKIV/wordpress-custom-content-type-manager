= Custom Post Type UI =

http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/custom-post-type-ui/

The Custom-Post Type UI plugin offers some of the same features, but I felt that its architecture was flawed: it stores data as taxonomical terms, which is conceptually awkward at a development level, and more importantly, it limits the each custom field to 200 characters of data, making it impossible to store certain types of custom content (e.g. long text fields).

= CMS Press =

http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/cms-press/

CMS Press offers a simple and clean implementation of custom post types.  It does include a taxonomy manager.  However, this plugin does NOT offer the ability to standardize custom fields for each post type.
