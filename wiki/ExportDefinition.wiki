#summary Exporting your custom definitions

Starting in version 0.8.9, you can export your custom content type definitions so you can import them on another !WordPress site with the Custom Content Type Manager plugin installed.  This can be a great way for you to share your customizations or to simply back up your work.

==Export to File==

In the left-hand !WordPress menu, under the main Custom Content Types menu is a "Import/Export" menu item.  From that page, you can export and import content type definitions.

=== File Format ===

The content type definitions are stored as JSON text.
