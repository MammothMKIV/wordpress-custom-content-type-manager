#summary Functions available to your theme files

Below are the functions available to your theme files so you can print out the values stored in your custom fields into your custom templates.  Some functions also return information _about_ the custom fields.

See includes/functions.php for more information.

= get_custom_field =

_string_ *get_custom_field*( string _$fieldname_ ) 

Gets the value of the custom field identified by _$fieldname_. This function is a convenience function that ties into !WordPress' [http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/get_post_meta get_post_meta()] function. This plugin prohibits requires that each custom field has a unique name (i.e. a key), whereas the !WordPress _get_post_meta()_ function allows for multiple rows to exist with the same key.

=== $fieldname ===         
(string) (required) The name of the custom field whose value you want to get.
  
== get_custom_field_meta ==

_mixed_ *get_custom_field_meta*( string _$fieldname_, string _$item_ [, string _$post_type_ ] ) 

This allows you to get information about the custom field's definition (i.e. its meta data). The definitions are stored in a multi-dimensional array, so we need 3 pieces of data to find the meta data: the fieldname, the name of the meta item, and the post type; the post_type is usually able to be determined automatically.

=== $fieldname ===         
(string) (required) The name of the custom field whose value you want to get.

=== $item ===         
(string) (required) The name of the definition item for this custom field whose value you want to get.

=== $post_type ===         
(string) (optional) The post_type containing the custom fields whose meta data you are trying to retrieve. Usually this can be determined automatically.

== Example ==

Examples are included in this Plugin's administration page: just click the link for "Show Sample Templates".

`<?php print get_custom_field('my_custom_field'); ?>`



= get_custom_field_def =

_array_ *get_custom_field_def*( string _$fieldname_[, string _$post_type_ ] ) 

Whereas the _get_custom_field_meta()_ function returns a single meta item from a field definition, the _get_custom_field_def()_ function returns the _entire_ definition array. 

=== $fieldname ===         
(string) (required) The name of the custom field whose value you want to get.

=== $post_type ===         
(string) (optional) The post_type containing the custom fields whose meta data you are trying to retrieve. Usually this can be determined automatically.

== Example ==

Put the following in one of your theme files, e.g. *single-test.php*:
`<?php print_r( get_custom_field_def('my_dropdown') ); ?>`

The output might be something like this:

{{{
Array
(
    [label] => My Dropdown
    [name] => my_dropdown
    [description] => Just an example desc
    [type] => dropdown
    [options] => Array
        (
            [0] => Male
            [1] => Female
        )

    [default_value] => Female
    [sort_param] => 2
)
}}}
