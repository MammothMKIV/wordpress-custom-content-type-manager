= Available Output Filters =

Some custom field types support *Output Filters*: these can control how data is displayed inside your themes when you use the *get_custom_field()* or *print_custom_field()* TemplateFunctions.

I've gotten plenty of emails from confused users asking [CreateImageField  how to get an image to appear in their theme files].  "I only see a number! WTF?!?" It's hard to explain in a few words how [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_key foreign keys] work, but all you have to remember is that the only thing that's stored in your custom image fields is the _ID_ of the image you selected.  This number is how we maintain referential integrity in our database tables, but by itself (i.e. unfiltered), it doesn't do much for your theme: you want some variation of the image that is being _referenced_ by that number.

The solution for this was in the docs the whole time, but the constant questioning was the primary impetus for implementing the following output filters.


<wiki:toc max_depth="2" />

----

== None ==

This is the default value for many field types, and it was the _only_ option available prior to version 0.8.9 of the plugin.

----

== Encode Email Address ==

This should be used for text field that you use to store email addresses.  When you are using this output filter and you print this field inside your theme files, the output is encrypted to help deter your email addresses from being harvested by spam bots.

----

== Image src ==

This converts a relation or image field's value into the full path to the image.  Use the !Image src output filter if you want to return the full path to the image, for example for use in your own image tag or link.

For example, if the my_image field has the "Image src" output field enabled, 

{{{ 
print_custom_field('my_image');
}}}
prints something like
{{{
http://yoursite.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/IMG_1045.jpg
}}}

----

== Full `<img>` tag ==

Use this output filter if you want to return a full image tag for your image.  This is the default output filter for image fields starting with version 0.8.9.

For example, if the my_image field has the "Full `<img>` tag" output field enabled, 

{{{
print_custom_field('my_image');`
}}}
Might return a value like:
{{{
<img width="640" height="480" 
 src="http://yoursite.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/IMG_1045.jpg" 
class="attachment-" alt="IMG_1045" title="IMG_1045" />
}}}

===Options===
Available options include the following:

 * thumbnail
 * medium 
 * large 
 * full (default)
 * or a 2-item array representing width and height in pixels

And any option available to the *size* paramter of the [http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/wp_get_attachment_image wp_get_attachment_image()] function.

----

== Array of image src, width, height ==

Instead of returning a single value for the image's src or a full image tag, this option causes 3 attributes from the image to be returned from the call to *get_custom_field()*: 
 
 * The image src
 * The image width
 * The image height

You can use the PHP [http://php.net/manual/en/function.list.php list] pragma to feed this array into 3 separate variables:

{{{
<?php list($src, $w, $h) = get_custom_field('my_image'); ?>
}}}

===Options===
Available options include the following:

 * thumbnail
 * medium 
 * large 
 * full (default)
 * or a 2-item array representing width and height in pixels

And any option available to the *size* paramter of the [http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/wp_get_attachment_image wp_get_attachment_image()] function.
