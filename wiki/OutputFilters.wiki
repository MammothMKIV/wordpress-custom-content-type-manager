The functionality of Output Filters was greatly enhanced in version 0.9.4 of the CCTM.  The reason they exist is pretty much the same reason !WordPress uses its own [http://codex.wordpress.org/Plugin_API filters]: they are used to modify data before sending it to the browser screen.

The reason Output Filters were implemented into the plugin was due primarily to the numerous emails I received from confused users asking [CreateImageField  how to get an image to appear in their theme files].  "I only see a number! WTF?!?" 

All you have to remember is that the only thing that's stored in your custom image fields is the _ID_ of the image you selected (it's a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_key foreign key]).  Most of the time, you don't want the number itself, you want the image that is _represented_ by that number.  The solution is to use an Output Filter to convert the number into an img tag or to the src of the image.


== Default Output Filter ==

Every custom field can specify a Default Output Filter.  This filter will be used on any standard instance of `get_custom_field()` or `print_custom_field()`.


== Standalone Use ==

Although the primary use of Output Filters is when they are used directly to modify the output of a custom field, the functions can also be called on their own.
