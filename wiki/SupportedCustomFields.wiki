By default, !WordPress supports only text custom fields.  The CCTM plugin allows you to define multiple types of custom fields to include inside your posts.  When you are adding a new custom field, you can choose to create any of the following types of field, or you can [CustomCustomFields develop your own].

= Overview =

It helps to distinguish our language here: when we say "create a custom field", we might be talking about adding a value to a single field within a given post (e.g. adding a phone number to our friend's contact information), or we might be talking about defining a new type of field for use with various content-types (e.g. creating a dropdown list of all possible brands of cell-phones).  Usually when we say "create a custom field", we are referring to the latter: we are talking about _defining_ a type of field.  We are creating a blueprint for a type of field that can be used on many different posts.

== Date ==

||http://s9.postimage.org/upm05ubgr/date.png|| [Date] fields are used to select a date.||
