= Introduction =

A class for querying !WordPress posts (including pages or custom post-types), including all custom fields via a unified API.  This class was written to overcome limitations in `WP_Query`, `query_posts`, and other built-in !WordPress methods.

The key function here is [get_posts].  See its dedicated page as well as the page with [get_posts_examples Examples of get_posts()].

_integer_ *count_posts*(array _$args_ `[`,$ignore_defaults`]`)

 * *$args* : criteria, inputs the same as for `get_posts()`.
 * *OUTPUT*: Integer count of the number of rows meeting the criteria.

=== <font color="green">public function debug()</font>===

_string_ *debug*()

 * *OUTPUT*: retrieves debugging information about the query you issued.  

You should run this after you have run this class' `get_posts()` function.  Optionally, you can pass arguments to the constructor and then call this method.

Returns an HTML formatted version of filtered input arguments useful for debugging.
