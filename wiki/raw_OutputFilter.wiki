= raw =

This is the default output filter for most fields and it was the _only_ filter available prior to version 0.8.9 of the CCTM.  The raw filter isn't much of a filter at all: it simply returns the input, but you can use it to override the Default Output Filter set for any custom field.


= Usage =

Generic invocation of any Output Filter occurs via the [TemplateFunctions#get_custom_field get_custom_field()] function:

_mixed_ *get_custom_field*( string _$input_ `[`, mixed _$options_ `]` ) 

 * *$input*: _mixed_.  
 * *$options*: _none_.
 * *OUTPUT*: _mixed_.  Whatever the $input was.

== Example 1==

You probably won't even think of the raw filter as a filter unless you invoke it verbosely using the colon-notation.  For example, imagine a field that normally returns an array of image parameters (to_image_array), but you want to see the raw post ID of the image stored:

{{{
<?php
print get_custom_field('my_img:raw');
?>
}}}
