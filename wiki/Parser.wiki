#summary The CCTM Parser
#sidebar SidebarFunctionReference

A lot of the CCTM relies on static formatting strings to format output. 

*Advantages*

 * Formatting strings are easily cached.
 * They cannot crash or be hacked.
 * Since they are static strings with only limited "windows" into dynamic functionality, they are far less likely to devolve into spaghetti.

*Disadvantages*

 * They are not PHP
 * They use their own custom syntax


= Placeholders =

==Simple Placeholders==

Basic placeholders begin with a `[+` and end with a `+]`, e.g. `[+post_title+]`.  Starting in version 0.9.6.1 of the CCTM, complex placeholders were supported due to enhancements in the parser functionality.  [OutputFilters Output Filters] can referenced in the placeholders, and the syntax is similar to what is supported by the [get_custom_field get_custom_field()] and [print_custom_field print_custom_field()] functions.


==Advanced Placeholders==

Starting with version 0.9.6.1 of the CCTM, you can use advanced placeholders in your formatting tpls.

`[+placeholder_name:outputfilter==option1||option2+]`
