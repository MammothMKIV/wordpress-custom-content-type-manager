#summary The CCTM Parser

A lot of the CCTM relies on static formatting strings to format output. 

*Advantages*

 * Formatting strings are easily cached.
 * They cannot crash or be hacked.
 * Since they are static strings with only limited "windows" into dynamic functionality, they are far less likely to devolve into spaghetti.

*Disadvantages*

 * They are not PHP
 * They use their own custom syntax


= Placeholders =

Basic placeholders begin with a `[+` and end with a `+]`, e.g. `[+post_title+]`.
