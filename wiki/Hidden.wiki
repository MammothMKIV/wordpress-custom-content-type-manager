== Field Definition (Meta Data)==

The field definition affects how instances of this field type will display in the !WordPress manager while creating or posts that contain instances of this field type.

 * *label* : the label identifies this field when you create or edit a post in the !WordPress manager
 * *name* : the name is a unique identifier used when saving values for instances of this field; it corresponds to the *meta_key* column *wp_postmeta* table.  You will use this name when retrieving field values inside of your themes via the `print_custom_field()` or `get_custom_field()` functions.
 * *description* : the description provides extra information to users as they create or edit a post in the !WordPress manager.
 * *class* : this affects the CSS class in the !WordPress manager that is used to display instances of this field type.
 * *extra* : this can be used to provide additional parameters to the text input, e.g. `size="10"` or custom javascript.. 
 * *default_value* : This is used to determine the default value for new instances of this field type. 
 * *output_filter* : [OutputFilters Output Filters] control how data is filtered before being sent to your theme files.
 * *evaluate_create_value* : if checked, the PHP code in the *create_value_code* textarea will be evaluated when the post containing this field is first created (i.e. it runs once only).
 * *evaluate_update_value* : if checked, the PHP code in the *update_value_code* textarea will be evaluated when the post containing this field is edited.
 * *evaluate_onsave* : if checked, the PHP code in the *onsave_code* textarea will be evaluated when the post containing this field is saved.
 * *create_value_code* : any PHP code that returns a value.  Runs only if the *evaluate_create_value* box is checked.
 * *update_value_code* : any PHP code that returns a value. Runs only if the *evaluate_update_value* box is checked.
 * *onsave_code* : any PHP code that returns a value. Runs only if the *evaluate_onsave* box is checked.

== Included Javascript/CSS files ==

NONE.

== Examples ==

Hidden fields usually store basic values, so they can usually be printed quite easily, without modification:

=== Use in your Template File ===

{{{
<?php print_custom_field('my_hidden'); ?>
}}}


== Generating a Value on Create==

In your field definition, check "Evaluate OnCreate".

Add PHP code to the "OnCreate" text area, e.g. this code to choose a random number between 1 and 100.

{{{
return rand(1,100)
}}}

This code is only executed once per post: when the post is first created -- the code executes as the form is _drawn_ (not as it is submitted).  After that, it will not execute again.

== Generating a Value on Edit ==

In your field definition, check "Evalate OnEdit".

Add PHP code to the "OnEdit" text area, e.g. this code to get the current timestamp

{{{
return date('Y-m-d H:i:s');
}}}

This code every time the edit form is _drawn_ (not as it is submitted).


== Generating a Value on Save ==

In your field definition, check "Evalate OnSave".

Add PHP code to the "OnSave" text area, e.g. this code to get the current timestamp

{{{
return date('Y-m-d H:i:s');
}}}

This code every time the edit form is _drawn_ (not as it is submitted).



== Example of Calculating a Value ==

Sometimes you need a field to calculate a value.  Since Hidden fields in the CCTM can execute PHP code,

=== Recommended Output Filters ===

None.

== Customizing Manager HTML ==

Hidden fields use the 2 standard tpls: field and wrapper.  See [CustomizingManagerHTML] for more information.

==== Field tpl====

The first of following tpls found will be used to format the field:

 * `fields/elements/{fieldname}.tpl`
 * `fields/elements/_hidden.tpl`
 * `fields/elements/_default.tpl`

==== Wrapper tpl ====

The first of the following tpls found will be used to wrap the output:

 # `fields/wrappers/{fieldname}.tpl`
 # `fields/wrappers/_hidden.tpl`
 # `fields/wrappers/_default.tpl`
