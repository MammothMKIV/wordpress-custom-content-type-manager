#summary Permissions errors surrounding the CCTM storage directory

= Introduction =

Most of the time, the CCTM plugin doesn't need to write anything to the filesystem on your webserver, however with the addition of support for [Import Importing] and [Export Exporting] content type definitions, it can save you a lot of time and trouble to be able to save your definitions on your webserver without having to upload or download them repeatedly.  

The ability to write to the file system is _not_ essential for normal operation of the plugin. It merely makes for a better user experience.


= Errors =

If PHP warnings are being displayed, you might see a warning like this:
{{{
Warning: mkdir() [function.mkdir]: Permission denied in /path/to/wp/html/wp-content/plugins/custom-content-type-mgr/includes/CCTM.php
}}}
