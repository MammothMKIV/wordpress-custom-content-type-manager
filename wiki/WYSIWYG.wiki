= Description =

||http://s8.postimage.org/5q2dpjybl/wysiwyg.png||A What-you-see-is-what-you-get (WYSIWYG) field is a textarea with formatting controls like you might see in a word processor (e.g. Microsoft Word).  It allows users to format text without needing to know HTML markup codes.||

= Examples =

The most obvious example for comparison is the main content block in standard !WordPress posts and pages.

= Warnings =

The way WordPress has implemented the TinyMCE rich-text-editor is not very modular, so I've encountered all kinds of errors with it.  

<font color="red">RECOMMENDATION</font>: always include the main content block and the title with your post-type definitions.  WordPress gets really weird without these fields.
