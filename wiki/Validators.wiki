The CCTM ships with the following Validators available:
 
 * [email_Validator Email] -- ensures the input is a valid email address
 * [number_Validator Number] -- ensures the input is a valid number (many configurable options)
 * [url_Validator URL] -- ensures the input is a valid URL


= How to Use =

You use a validator when you are defining a custom field.  Each field contains various options, and one of those options is what kind of validation rule to use for that field.

 # Create a new Custom Field : *CCTM --> Custom Fields*
 # Scroll down to the "Validation" section.
 # Choose a validation rule and fill out any options (if any).
 # Add your field to one or more post-types under the "Associations" section.
 # Save your field 

Now when you create posts or pages that use this field, the fields will be validated when users save the page.  They can still _save_ the page, but the page cannot be published until the fields contain valid input.
