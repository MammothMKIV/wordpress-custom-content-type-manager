= Description =

This *invisible* Output Filter is rarely used.  If a custom field specifies *invisible* as its output filter, that means that the custom field should remain invisible to the template.  This only happens in rare circumstances:

 # A custom field does not save any data to the database, it merely is used as a "helper" field, e.g. a field that helps the user fill out other areas of the form. 
 # When you don't want the custom field to be included in the generation of a sample template.  


= Usage =

You shouldn't ever call the invisible filter directly: it obliterates anything sent to it.
