#summary Configuring Search Parameters

Starting with version 0.9.5, you can configure the search parameters that define which posts are available for selection in a relation, image, or media field.

When you define a relation custom field, note that there is a button for "Search Parameters".  When you click it, you get a thickbox that allows you to control which posts are available for selection in your posts and pages that use that custom field.

You can override the default configurations by writing your own configuration file.

Inside of your !WordPress uploads directory, the CCTM uses its own directory, e.g. `wp-uploads/cctm` -- that's where we put all of our CCTM stuff.

I have to point out here that this delves into some *convention* instead of just raw *configuration*.  CCTM tries to use configuration whenever possible, but in some cases, I just had to use some tricks to make it quicker to edit. 

The little secret is that any configuration file inside of *custom-content-type-manager/config/search_parameters* can be overridden by placing a file into *uploads/cctm/config/search_parameters*.  That is to say, the user-created files inside of your upload directory take precedence over the the included built-in configurations.

How to explain this... you configure a form which in turn configures the search.
