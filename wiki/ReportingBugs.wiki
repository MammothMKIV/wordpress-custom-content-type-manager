= Introduction =

If you're going to [http://code.google.com/p/wordpress-custom-content-type-manager/issues/list File a Bug Report], please make sure that you do it effectively, and please be willing to follow up with additional information.  I do care and I want to make my plugin better, but it's impossible for me to fix things unless I can see what exactly is broken.

Do not email me directly about bugs unless you want to hire me for paid support.  If you aren't sure whether it's a bug or not, then it's fine to ask around in the forums, but once you've confirmed that it's a bug, create a new Issue by clicking the Issues tab and entering in the relevant info.

To file a good bug report, please follow all of the following points.

= Include All System Information =

Inside of your !WordPress site, there is a menu-item created by the Custom Content Type Manager plugin which reads _Custom Content Types_.  You can click it (or ANY of the CCTM's admin pages) and you will see a footer that contains a link to *Report a Bug*.

That page was designed to help you (the user) easily include the most relevant information about your system.  Just copy and paste the info from the yellow textarea into your bug report.

I really need to see *all* of this information!

= List the Exact Steps to Reproduce the Problem =

I need to see exactly what you did to encounter the problem. If I can't see the problem myself, I cannot fix it.

Include screenshots or a short video!  [http://www.techsmith.com/download/jing/default.asp Jing] is free software that runs on Windows and on Macs and lets you easily capture your screen and share it via a link.  Screencast videos can save _hours_ of emailing back and forth, because no matter how hard you try, sometimes there are details that we forget to mention.

= Include the Comparison: Expected Result vs. Actual Result =

A lot of bug reports are useless because the user includes a link and says "SEE!?!! IT'S BROKEN!!".  That does nothing for me.  A valid bug report compares what you _actually_ saw with what you _expected_ to see.  

For example "I got a horse.  I expected a zebra."  

= Make Sure You're Using the Latest Version =

WordPress doesn't always packaging plugins correctly and it tries to release updates over time, so you may not have the latest version even though your dashboard says there are no updates available.  Check the http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/custom-content-type-manager/ page to double-check that you have the latest version.

Thanks!
