= Features =

The Custom Content Type Manager is one of several plugins for !WordPress that allows users to create custom content types (a.k.a. post_types).


==All types of Custom Fields==
By default, !WordPress only supports custom _text_ fields.  That's kind of boring, and it may not help you adequately display your content.  This plugin offers date fields, WYSIWYG rich text fields, image fields, dropdown fields and more!

==Standardized Custom Fields==
Another shortcoming of !WordPress is its inability to standardize its custom fields.  If you need 100 custom fields added to your posts, each time you created a new post, you would have to manually add those same 100 fields, one after the other (and let's hope you don't mistype something!!).  

This plugin solves that problem by _standardizing_ your custom fields, so instantly, the same fields display in the same order for all your posts or pages!  No more guessing about which custom fields were used on your posts!

==Sample templates==
Every time you create custom content, you need custom templates to help you _display_ that data.  This plugin dynamically generates sample template code as a reference for you.  This gives you a good head start when skinning all the various types of pages that your custom content types use.

==Import and Export Definitions==
If you are setting up several similar sites and you want them all to share the same content-types and custom fields, all you have to do is set up one site the way you want, then [Export] the definition for use on the other sites.  This feature can save you lots of time and guarantee consistency across sites!
