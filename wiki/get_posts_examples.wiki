== get_posts returns the completely wrong post ==

Be careful that you don't accidentally use `get_post` when you meant to use `get_posts`.  `get_post` expects an integer post ID as input, so if you instead pass it a series of arguments intended for `get_posts`, this will evaluate to some integer via some incomprensible bit of PHP number crunching, and you may get a result from the database that is completely unexpected.
