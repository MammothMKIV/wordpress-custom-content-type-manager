== Display Foreign Post Types ==

The CCTM is not the only plugin that might be using custom post-types on your site.  Optionally, you can choose to display the foreign post-types in your CCTM manager screens.   Seeing the other post-types can help increase your awareness of what other plugins are doing on your site, or maybe you're just curious.  Enabling this option is merely a helpful "FYI" insight into your site.

= Custom Field Settings =

Some custom fields may require their own settings pages (e.g. for entering an API key).  3rd party developers can create their own custom fields (instructions on that are coming), but depending on the requirements of the field, there may be settings options that appear for each type of field.
