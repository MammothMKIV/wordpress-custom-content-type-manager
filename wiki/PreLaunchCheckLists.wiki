Here's my running list of things to test before releasing a build.

 # Create a custom content type, check for any errors
 # Add one of each field to it, check for any errors.
 # Create a post in this new content type, check for any errors.
 # Add a value for each field, including each custom field, check for errors.
 # Save the post, navigate away, then edit the post. Verify that all values were preserved.
 # Check the sample template for the post_type: are there any errors?  Is it valid?
 # Try using the sample template: view a post you created.  Are all fields represented correctly?
 # Try re-ordering custom fields and saving the order.  Is the new order used when you edit the field?
 # Export the .cctm.json file for this setup.  Try importing that definition on another site.  Any errors?
 # In the template file, try using different Output Filters.  Any errors or unexpected behavior?
