 * *Title:* set the title of the widget (similar to many other widgets)
 * *Search Criteria:* this allows you to define which posts you want to list.  Note that the controls that show up on this form are configurable by the configuration file in *config/search_parameters/_widget.php* (see [Customizations] for information on customizing this and other forms in the CCTM).
 * *Formatting String:* this is what formats each result returned.  _It should be a list item!_

The default formatting string is this:

{{{
<li><a href="[+permalink+]">[+post_title+]</a></li>
}}}
