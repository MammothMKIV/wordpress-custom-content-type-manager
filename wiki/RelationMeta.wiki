Important points about RelationMeta fields:

The following fields cannot be added as a relation meta sub-field:
 
 * Relation
 * Image
 * Media
 * Another Relation Meta
 * WYSIWYG

Also note the following limitations:

 * No validation is supported for the sub-fields. (All validation rules are overridden).
 * Sub-fields may not be repeatable (the "Is Repeatable" setting is overridden).


= Use in your Templates =

RelationMeta fields _always_ store their data as a JSON data structure, e.g.

{{{
{
   "413":{
      "age":"32",
      "birthday":"1999-12-31"
   }
}
}}}

Where the post ID is the first key, and then the sub-fields' names are the subsequent keys.

Fair Warning: if you're not comfortable navigating data structures and you need the simplicity of a straight-forward output-filter for everything printed in your template, then Relation-Meta fields are probably not for you.  They store complex data, and I can't think of a straightforward way to format it other than looping over their contents using custom PHP.
