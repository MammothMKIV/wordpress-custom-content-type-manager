Important points about RelationMeta fields:

The following fields cannot be added as a relation meta sub-field:
 
 * Relation
 * Image
 * Media
 * Another Relation Meta
 * WYSIWYG

No validation is supported for the sub-fields.
Sub-fields may not be repeatable.

RelationMeta fields _always_ store their data as a JSON data structure, e.g.

{{{
{
   "413":{
      "age":"32",
      "birthday":"1999-12-31"
   }
}
}}}

Where the post ID is the first key, and then the sub-fields' names are the subsequent keys.
