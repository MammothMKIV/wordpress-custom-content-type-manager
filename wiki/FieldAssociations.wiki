= Associating Fields with Content Types =

As of version 0.9.4, custom field definitions are _normalized_: you define the field once and you can add it to any content type.

There are 2 places where you can make this association:

 * *Custom Content Types --> Custom Content Types --> {_choose a content type_} --> Manage Custom Fields*
 * *Custom Content Types --> Custom Fields --> {_choose a field_} --> Edit*

If you choose the first, you can affect the order that the fields display in by dragging and dropping the fields into the order you want them.

----------------------
== Manage Custom Fields ==

This way of managing associations is more flexible because it allows you determine the order of the fields. This lets you look at a given *content type* and choose which fields you want to be included on that content type.

*Custom Content Types --> Custom Content Types --> {_choose a content type_} --> Manage Custom Fields*

Check the fields you want to include in this content type, drag them into the order you want, then click save.


---------------
== Edit a Custom Field ==

This option lets you manage the associations from a slightly different standpoint: it lets you look at a given *custom field* and choose where that field should be displayed.

*Custom Content Types --> Custom Fields --> {_choose a field_} --> Edit*

Check the content types where you want this field displayed and then click *Save*. 

You must go to the *Manage Custom Fields* edit screen to set the order of the fields!
