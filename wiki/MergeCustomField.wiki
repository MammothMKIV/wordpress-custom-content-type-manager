= Merge Custom Field Definitions =

Starting with version 0.9.4, you can merge custom field definitions.  To get to this function, in the !WordPress manager, go to the *Custom Content Types* menu, and then select the *Custom Fields* option.  For each defined custom field, there is an option for *Merge*.

Merging causes a field to be renamed in the database and the old definition to be deleted. For example, if you merge "cats" into "dogs", all instances of "cats" in the database will be renamed to "dogs" and the field definition for "cats" will be removed. 

Be careful about merging a field into a field of a different type! You may encounter unpredictable results!
