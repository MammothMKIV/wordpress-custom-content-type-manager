= Description =

The _gallery_ filter formats one or many images using a formatting template.  This was developed specifically to help streamline the process of displaying multiple images. Available 0.9.5.6.

= Usage =

Generic invocation of any Output Filter occurs via the [TemplateFunctions#get_custom_field get_custom_field()] function:

_mixed_ *get_custom_field*( string _$input_ `[`, mixed _$options_ `]` ) 

 * *$input*: _mixed_.  
 * *$options*: _string_: a formatting template containing placeholders for image data.  The default formatting string is the following:
{{{
<div class="cctm_gallery" id="cctm_gallery_[+i+]">
<img height="[+height+]" width="[+width+]" src="[+guid+]" title="[+post_title+]" alt="[+alt+]" class="cctm_image" id="cctm_image_[+i+]"/>
</div>
}}}

Note: The formatting template includes several helpful placeholders designed specifically to assist the formatting of images.  These include the following:

 * `[+i+]` - a simple iterator, starting with 1 and counting up for each image that is formatted.
 * `[+alt+]` - contains the alternate text for an image.
 * `[+height+]` - the image height is calculated automatically for you.
 * `[+width+]` - the image width is calculated automatically for you.
 * `[+help+]` - as with other CCTM formatting templates, the _help_ placeholder can be used to list all available placeholders.
 
* *OUTPUT*: _string_.  An instance of the formatting template, processed once for each image.

== Example 1==

The simplest invocation relies on the 
{{{
<?php print_custom_field('my_images:gallery'); ?>
}}}
