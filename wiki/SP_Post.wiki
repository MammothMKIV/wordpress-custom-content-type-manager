#summary SP_Post class reference

The *SP_Post* class offers functions to create, update, and delete your posts and their meta data (i.e. CRUD).  Managing your post and all related data via a single interface is simpler than the alternative of using iterations of the !WordPress [http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/wp_insert_post wp_insert_post()] and [http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/update_post_meta update_post_meta()] and related functions.  

Using *SP_Posts* has these important distinctions:

 # It does not call any actions or filters when it is executed, so for better or for worse, there is no way for 3rd parties to intervene with this.
 # It automatically creates/updates/deletes all custom fields in the postmeta table without the need to have to use the update_post_meta() and related functions.
 # It does not check for user permissions. If you're running around in the PHP code, you have full run of the database. BEWARE!
