= Standard Installation =

Installing the CCTM is the same as installing other !WordPress plugins.  You can install it from the !WordPress manager by navigating to the *Plugins" menu and clicking the "Add New" button.  Activate the plugin once you have downloaded it.

= Manual Installation =

 # Download a .zip file of the plugin.  See the [Downloads] page for how to download a .zip file of the plugin (including the latest development version).
 # If possible, upload the .zip file to your web server and unzip it to the `wp-content/plugins/` directory.  If you cannot unzip files on your web server, then unzip it on your desktop and upload the contents to the `wp-content/plugins/` directory.  When finished you should have a folder for `wp-content/plugins/custom-content-type-manager/`
 # Activate the plugin from the !WordPress manager.

= Activation Errors =

The CCTM runs tests as it is activated to determine whether or not it can run on your !WordPress installation. See the [Requirements] to ensure that your system can safely run the CCTM.
