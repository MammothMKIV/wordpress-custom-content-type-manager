= Description =

Starting with version 0.9.4, developers can create their own PHP classes that describe their own custom fields.  You can use this feature to write your own types of custom fields, just like with [CustomOutputFilters Custom Output Filters].

--------

= The Base Class =

*CCTM_FormElement* is an abstract class that defines the behavior for all custom fields.

By looking at the base class inside of *wp-content/plugins/custom-content-type-manager/includes/CCTM_FormElement.php*, you can see the following variables and methods.  Here's a brief description of each relevant variable and function.

=== protected $props ===

_array_ : an associative array that defines which properties each instance of the field will have.
	
=== public function admin_init() ===

_void_ *admin_init*()

Override this function to register any necessary CSS/JavaScript required by your field.  For examples, look at the *relation.php* field.

=== public function get_create_field_definition()===

_string_ *public function get_create_field_definition*()

This should return (not print) form elements that handle all the controls required to define this type of field.  Normally, you shouldn't need to implement this function.  Usually implementing the *get_edit_field_definition()* is enough.

===abstract public get_edit_field_definition()===

_string_ *get_edit_field_definition*($current_values)

This should return (not print) form elements that handle all the controls required to edit the field definition.
