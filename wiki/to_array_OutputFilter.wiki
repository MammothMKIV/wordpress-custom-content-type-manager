= to_array =

This is the default output filter for [MultiSelect multi-select] fields: the raw format is a JSON string.  Selecting the "Array" output filter will convert the JSON string into a PHP array.  It is equivalent to the following:

{{{ 
$raw = get_custom_field('my_image');
$array = json_decode($raw, true);
}}}

The `print_custom_field()` function isn't useful if you have a [MultiSelect multi-select] field using the Array output filter: you can't simply print an array, you're going to have to do something with it. 

= Usage =

 * *INPUT*: mixed.  Normally a JSON formatted string, e.g. `["dog","cat","pig"]`
 * *OUTPUT*: array. E.g. `array('dog','cat','pig')`
