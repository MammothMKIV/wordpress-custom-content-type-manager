#summary Documentation for Relation custom fields

= Description =

The relation field stores an integer foreign key: it's the ID of the post you've selected as the relation.

What do you do with that integer?  You probably want the _post_ that integer represents, so you'll want to use !WordPress' *get_post()* function:

Try something like this in your template:
`$related_post = get_pot( get_custom_field('my_relation') );`
