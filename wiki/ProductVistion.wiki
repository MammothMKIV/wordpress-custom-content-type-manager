=  The Roadmap for the Custom Content Type Manager Plugin=

Where is this plugin headed?  We have big things planned for it, but it takes time to implement.

== Mission Statement ==

The goal is to make !WordPress a viable CMS with flexible content types while leveraging the built-in !WordPress technologies to accomplish this.   

== Guiding Design Principles ==

 * No database modifications are made.
 * The site should still function if the plugin is uninstalled
 * The User Interface should be intuitive
 * The plugin should be well-documented.
