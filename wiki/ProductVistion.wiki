=  The RoadMap for the Custom Content Type Manager Plugin=

Where is this plugin headed?  We have big things planned for it, but it takes time to implement.

== Mission Statement ==

The goal is to make !WordPress a viable CMS with flexible content types while leveraging the built-in !WordPress technologies to accomplish this.  One goal is that the user should be able to uninstall this plugin at any time and still be able to use their site.  

== Guiding Design Principles ==

* No database modifications are made.
* The site should still function if the plugin is uninstalled
* The User Interface should be intuitive
* The plugin should be well-documented.
